Project Title: Online Banking Payment Functionality Automation

Objective: Automate the testing of the payment functionality in an online banking application to ensure accuracy, security, and reliability of transactions.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Automation Testing Framework: Selenium WebDriver
Test Framework: PyTest
Reporting: Allure Framework
Project Structure:

Setup:

Install necessary libraries: Selenium WebDriver, PyTest, Allure Framework.
Configure the WebDriver for browser automation (e.g., Chrome WebDriver).
Test Cases:

Login Test:

Verify that the user can successfully log in to the online banking application.
Handle both valid and invalid login scenarios.
Payment Test:

Navigate to the payment page.
Enter payment details such as recipient, amount, description, etc.
Verify that the payment is processed successfully.
Test various scenarios including different payment amounts, invalid recipient, insufficient funds, etc.
Transaction History Test:

Verify that the transaction history is updated correctly after making a payment.
Check for the presence of the latest transaction in the history.
Assertions and Validations:

Implement assertions to verify the correctness of UI elements, transaction details, and error messages.
Validate the payment amount, recipient details, and transaction status.
Reporting:

Integrate Allure Framework for generating detailed test reports.
Reports should include information about test cases executed, passed, failed, and any exceptions encountered.
Test Data Management:

Implement data-driven testing by providing different sets of test data for payment scenarios.
Use test data from external sources or generate data programmatically.
Test Environment Management:

Ensure test environment stability by managing browser versions, dependencies, and configurations.
Handle any environment-related issues that may affect test execution.
Additional Considerations:

Implement Page Object Model (POM) for better test maintenance and readability.
Implement wait mechanisms to handle dynamic elements and ensure synchronization.
Use logging to capture detailed information during test execution for troubleshooting.
Implement CI/CD integration for automated test execution as part of the build pipeline.
Conclusion:
By automating the payment functionality of the online banking application, this project demonstrates your proficiency in automation testing, particularly in Selenium WebDriver, PyTest, and Allure Framework. It showcases your ability to ensure the accuracy and reliability of critical functionalities in a financial application, which is crucial for maintaining customer trust and satisfaction.
